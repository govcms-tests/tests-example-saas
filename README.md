# GovCMS Project Scaffolding

This codebase provides a Drupal GovCMS site ready for
hosting on the GovCMS platform (Lagoon).

**Note**: If you are a new GovCMS customer visiting this page on
[Github](https://github.com/govcms/scaffold)
you may prefer to wait for the GovCMS service desk to create your project in Gitlab.

To make this codebase function you must first initialise it.
```
ahoy init project_name type version
```

 * `type`: May be `saas` or `paas`
 * `version`: May be `8`, `9` or `10`
